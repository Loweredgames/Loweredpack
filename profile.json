Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"

fabric mod to add controller support to Minecraft Java - with a focus on compatibility.\n\n## Why Controlify?\n\nControlify is a mod that focuses on mod compatibility, ease of use, configurability and bleeding edge features. \n\nControlify comes with a huge range of settings to fine-tune each of your controllers *individually*, including vibration strength, every single controller input bind (no hardcoding!) and more.\n\nI, the developer, have contributed to popular mods such as Sodium and Iris to get compatibility working in a native-like state, collaborated with do-a-barrel-roll to get elytra flying working seemlessly with controllers (and flight joysticks) and plan to do much more of this in the future.\n\nThe mod is also easy to use for beginners, with default-on button guides, so you know how to interact with the game with a new input scheme.\n\n## Q&A\n\n### Does it support Steam Deck?\n\nYes! Controlify has been tested on the Steam Deck, and works great. The gyro features built-in to Controlify\ndo not currently work on the Steam Deck, but you can utilise Steam Input's gyro -> mouse emulation to get\nworking gyro.\n\n### Does it support *insert generic gamepad here*?\n\nYes! Controlify supports most standard gamepad controllers out of the box.\n\n## Features\n\n### Controller vibration\n\nControlify supports controller vibration, which has not been seen before for PC versions of Minecraft,\nincluding Bedrock Windows 10 Edition. Configure the intensity of each vibration source, with\ncomplex vibration patterns for lots of aspects of the game (e.g. when you take damage).\n\n![picture of vibration config](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/8a7809d07d9e1d9e3002007d7e5e13b73ce8fb5b.png)\n\n### Built-in gyro support\n\nControlify has built-in support for controller gyroscopes, allowing you to make fine movements in-game\nwith your controller. This can be combined with [flick stick](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/bw5xct/flick_stick_is_a_new_way_to_control_3d_games_with/) to be able to use a controller without\nthe compromise.\n\n### Container cursor\n\nJust like in bedrock edition, you can move a cursor across your inventory, and interact\nwith it in a controller-friendly way. With dedicated buttons for quick move, dropping etc. Controlify also comes with cursor snapping, so you don't need to be so precise with cursor movements.\n\n![container cursor screenshot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/249a2cbaea9b374b33fe67717380e732693dd37a.png)\n\n### Controller identification\n\nControlify has the ability to identify the make and model of your controller automatically,\nand displays relevant button textures for your controller. This is also extendable by resource packs, changing up the button textures in a different style and adding some of your own, more niche controller identifiers.\n\n![demonstration of data-driven identification](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/ec1408d51787b87525b9fb0f2e56b54c5910d384.png)\n\n### Joystick support\n\nYou can connect any joystick to the mod and map it with your own names and textures, with an unlimited amount of inputs per controller.\n\n### Button guide\n\nThere is a simple overlay in-game that displays the buttons you can press\nbased on your player's state and look direction. This is useful for new players, who\nhave not yet memorised the controls.\n\n![image of in-game button guide](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/57c41cee14680c74faf947c5cff355c0af4c35b3.png)\n\nAlso, some GUIs display controller buttons on elements that have a controller shortcut, to easily navigate with a controller like you should be able to.\n\n![image of in-screen button guide](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/511e4182137bb27bbdf95539c8265b9af2038761.webp)\n\n### Containerised Controllers\n\nThis mod is built around the fact that each controller is completely separate, with it's own configuration, bindings etc.\nThis means it will be trivial to add support for split-screen play in the future.\n\n### Built for mod compatibility\n\nGUI operation has been abstracted into a simple API, which allows other mods to easily add support for their own GUIs,\nwithout convoluted support throughout the whole mod's codebase, making it difficult for third parties to integrate.\n\n![demonstration of dabr compat](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/8ee5ec167bc5f8be96da725b10707094559138cb.gif)\n\n*Video recorded using do-a-barrel-roll with a Thrustmaster HOTAS flightstick*\n\n### Automatic controller deadzone calibration\n\nThe deadzone values of your controller are automatically calibrated, \nmeaning you don't have to worry about it.\n\n![image of calibration screen](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/f5f8e2a0a05e61adb95dd919760b424165ca5d14.png)\n\n## What is to come?\n\nA few features in various points in the horizon are:\n\n- Explicit Steam Deck support, with the ability to interface with its gyroscope and be able to handle its extra buttons on the back of the device.\n- A better way to change controller bindings, possibly a custom graphical GUI to pick what buttons do what actions, not the other way around.\n- Split-screen support of some degree.\n\n## Backports?\n\nThis mod is only and will only be available for **1.19.4** and above, this is because in 1.19.4, Mojang\nintroduced arrow key navigation which was easily ported to controller, below 1.19.4, this is not possible.\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](/LICENSE).\n","published":"2023-02-05T13:04:45.141986Z","updated":"2023-11-10T23:58:41.888794Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":255830,"followers":221,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.19.4-pre1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20-pre2","23w05a","23w06a"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["L5wBKwLP","O4X3TycI","XvbPbLuc","ViaGpYcG","mvoRZ4lr","TSgUsWWO","ZshsEOjG","OVsSpUi5","4eYmOLUb","jvUMhWpD","3L7GCFAd","v9yBe6Ye","hA4E3OIW","pKaQjz0y","60bCNc7N","FLIWpoEL","qHzBhRrd","h5ZThJ8W","FXJNOVCT","GJuiYIvz","uPbwSdJT","aT4dMJAD","xncNJgTg","y7xMOOMU","Oquy1mdB","L2JeMo5i","MSWp1Dsg","CzlyUU6C","QPb34aQS","5MMK5oJQ","E0IjfW25"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/4f8cdb3933f9efa0c5dfd5574d3ad6b101c7f3ef.png"},"version":{"id":"E0IjfW25","project_id":"DOUdJVEm","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"Controlify 1.7.0+1.20.2","version_number":"1.7.0+1.20.2","changelog":"# Controlify 1.7.0 for 1.20.1\n\nUpdated to 1.20.2.\n\n## Changes since 1.7.0-beta.3\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fix crash when sometimes opening chat screen, even without a controller (#186)\n\n## New Features\n\n- Added D-Pad snapping in container screens\n- Keyboard-like movement whitelist and warning toast when joining new servers\n- Added bind to open F3 debug screen\n- More snap points on recipe book\n- Allow users to define a custom SDL natives path (so you can put them in a common dir if you want)\n- Add a reset all binds button to controls tab\n- Added an SDL download screen that appears with a progress bar when downloading SDL2 for the first time or an update.\n\n## Changes\n\n- Switched to Java Native Access (JNA) from Java Native Interface (JNI) for SDL2 native library.\n    - This should fix issues on Linux and macOS when loading SDL2.\n    - This makes adding more features with SDL2 easier in the future.\n- Provided `gamecontrollerdb.txt` to SDL and GLFW to (hopefully) improve controller compatibility.\n- Controller calibration now detects triggers on joysticks.

YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config.

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it.

Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2023-10-29T14:59:04.455764Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":1219658,"followers":1588,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.19.4-pre1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","22w42a","23w05a","23w06a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU","vede4iWJ","n8X2J9Hh"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"vede4iWJ","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"3.3.0-beta.1+1.20.2 (Fabric)","version_number":"3.3.0-beta.1+1.20.2-fabric","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.3.0 (Beta 1) for Minecraft 1.20.2\n\nAs you can see, a lot of the contributions to this release are from other people! That's incredible, and I'm very\nthankful for the community commitment to this project!\n\nThis release is a beta release, which just means that I'm not 100% sure that everything works as intended.\nI encourage developers to at least try this build out, and if there are no problems, you're safe to release (I hope!).\n\n## New Features\n\n- Added new methods to add options to groups and categories, including conditional adding and option suppliers.\n  This increases the chances you don't need to break the huge builder chain present of YACL, so you can just keep writing,\n  even if you need to conditionally add an option, or run some code around the option. Look for `optionIf`!\n\n## Changes\n\n- Support for the `Home` and `End` keys. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))\n- Add functionality for `Ctrl + Left/Right` (you can now jump over words, without selecting it). ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))\n- Make the 'finding the next word' functionality more consistent with other programs. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))\n- Caret now pauses flickering when moving it. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))\n- Position the caret and the highlight area being the same height as the text. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))\n- Render the caret above the selection, instead of below. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))\n\n## Fixes\n\n- Fix `NumberFieldController` increasing their values by a power of 10 when clicking on the screen. Issue @ [#103](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/issue/103) PR @ [#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108)\n- Fix values not updating when unfocusing a string controller. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))\n- Fix a bug where the caret is not rendered at the beginning of the text in string/number field controllers. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))\n- Fix dropdowns not being sorted correctly with capital letters. ([#114](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/114))\n\n## Misc\n\n- Added debug JVM property `-Dyacl3.debug.imageFiltering=true/false` which applies experimental filtering to images\n  to make them look better. I'd like your feedback on this!\n- You now no longer need to add additional repositories to your `build.gradle`.\n  You can safely remove:\n  - `https://maven.quiltmc.org/repository/release/`\n  - `https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/`\n\n## Translation Updates\n\n- Add Dutch translation. ([#121](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/121))\n- Add Italian translation.

This will explain the absence of updates. Why again? It's just not fun anymore and I am always worried about once again being embedded in annoying discord drama that somehow manages to suck every bit of enjoyment out of modding. There hasn't been anyone willing to step up and take over development and that's partly my fault. This notice is months late. If you enjoy fastload and intend to maintain it, just contact me on discord for a discussion. Please keep in mind that I won't respond quickly because I don't really use discord much at all anymore. Thank you for taking your time to read this!\n\n# Short explanation\nFastload is a *relatively* simple mod that changes some crucial parts of world loading to speed it up.\n\n# Environments\n- Client (Optional)\n- Server (Optional)\n\n# Credits\n- StockiesLad (Owner)\n- JoostMSoftware (Co-Owner)\n- AbdElAziz333 (Forge)\n- VidTu (Ksyxis (Idea))\n- kennytv (Forcecloseloadingscreen (Code))\n\n# Features\n- 441 Pre-generator: Entirely yanks it to sync chunk generation with chunk rendering.\n- Loading Screens: Cancellable (Configurable)\n- Rendering: Pre-rendering Phase (Configurable)\n\n# Suggested With\n- C2ME: Optimises chunk generation.\n- Sodium: Optimises chunk rendering.\n\n# Explanation\nThe 441 chunk loading engine is pretty much what the name is. The reason for it being 441 chunks is that\nit generates chunks in a 10 chunk radius as a square. So multiply that by 2, add 1 (because you are standing\non a chunk) and square it. Fastload removes this *feature* as it is a huge waste of time. Instead, it will\nonly load 1 chunk (the spawn chunk) and loads the rest of the spawn region during early rendering.\n\nAlong with that, it also replaces some of the loading screens with its own implementation. This pretty much\nallows rendering to begin immediately instead of it being halted until the player spawn packet is received.\n\n# Links\n- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload\n- Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastload\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/fMSnenNSXM\n\n","published":"2022-06-04T16:09:02.891982Z","updated":"2023-08-15T12:36:53.077035Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":768405,"followers":1107,"categories":["optimization","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["OAv8CrM0","hR5aj90D","Lbph3YVy","nkXCDjTX","CVP8s8T3","tFMofdbs","3j5R1tqr","opd0zx0e","iiKA1DWl","DVbkQeRT","bAEd4DsW","PjaIK1Vp","tAJHf9G7","wIStpaL0","8J8D4v6o","1wIMDix7","BnPn5A62","f4sYhmcE","meWCSzii","DJkYeZd5","1f1DA0KB","QNff3l3l","QlIwIIh9","C2LwOzJk","1uyZI4Sv","FKmzXNtY","K88McHch","DQlQxhhM","qIDVvUbg","nAfxWveV","MmygcB2M","zNe7bwry","Tv3wOvtj","ksl46t40","qkR1zzal","dKaZj3NX","bxgfNPxE","LtO049ip","RWontocM","tMBTPH4j","rGmamzE5","gdXi90uO","Dsgo7CSj","2Yda0wxa","pPHZxvSq","mBNst1pT","NHYFVTEV","WyunD6Js","N1SrNeBH","IpZXHH55","rxKwFSer","ZlGXwJvh","TQqs51tn","DadZpSjE","tMPV3Kkg","ZF0uERgW","FpDn2R2L","gIRDVsr1","a5IjqNvz","DlCLRU3a","WU1it2AO","FU50wLzH","DhZ4Ja4S","Y0vyVBp6","suyTpHDo","gO58JOqR","K9vr5fdy","OQyAqgWH","AWGFfzNY","Jy0nBwT7","n2GBDiY8","YvKzIdFE","lbg7lLOP","XzqjhWvy","GCH0zDV1","cOIVKLwU","FswsA1ru","pDTCLzgm","s3zsS0HW","tykaPrWr","ILYiaB6n","jbjSMJqM","JpRTQ4PR","vD6ndABa","WryJ0FUZ","FcFh2FAO","PB8AbQO3","BwDnLgzN","OxwM6hRt","u4FVRRGd","ys9T20o4","47qpvpOP","P17HkM27","9Kgnmrza","3cboK7gk","HDvAnQIw","Z8CqLDDO","nHeyxX0A","fbLmfqa5","ka9OYmub","5caSj7kt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/47742fe96d19cdad9a3eb6a73bd9c7c1547fb4ad.png"},"version":{"id":"ys9T20o4","project_id":"kCpssoSb","author_id":"6RqzXTwc","featured":false,"name":"Fastload+1.18.2-1.20-3.4.0","version_number":"3.4.0","changelog":"Fixed a couple bugs, improved internal api, updated some dependencies, updated embedded fabric api to support the latest snapshot","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-05-03T07:15:33.055038Z","downloads":327736,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"024e9aa775037fe8727ac8aca55f68d2f6782dd87d099446f967ebbeb6eab73f0f0580eca100cb565f70bab02abce03239af0fca17248ceef2c05caa1cfcdd1e","sha1":"b57e4d594031638b0dc076a3b6e501f417700577"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/versions/ys9T20o4/Fastload%2B1.18.2-1.20-3.4.0.jar","filename":"Fastload+1.18.2-1.20-3.4.0.jar","primary":true,"size":567412,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"6RqzXTwc","username":"StockiesLad","name":"Fluffy Bumblebee","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60066663?v=4","bio":"A lad from stockies mate.","created":"2022-06-04T16:04:13.709905Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"GIn4UWLW","username":"KirboSoftware","name":"Joost","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80041873?v=4","bio":"I'm a junior software engineer who creates minecraft mods in my spare time and help with projects when I can","created":"2022-06-04T15:56:54.106893Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Co-owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":false},"file_name":"Fastload+1.18.2-1.20-3.4.0.jar.disabled"},"mods\\Jade-1.20.2-fabric-12.2.1.jar":{"sha512":"f49efb6a984ec602828a7340f04de0bdfe2725f2f4592e6de792570f0e6c6a2fb03948d34b51ce8f4ceccbfa01d11374b817cf1ca4b34ca773dab03737431354","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"nvQzSEkH","slug":"jade","project_type":"mod","team":"UadxHcYS","title":"Jade 🔍","description":"Shows information about what you are looking at.

CTOV adds 23 village variants and 14 pillager outpost variants, each of which is tailored to the terrain, theme, and biome of your Minecraft world.\n\nCTOV will not be backported beyond 1.18.2 for the mod version and 1.17 for the datapack version. This means that if you are playing an older version of Minecraft, you will not be able to use CTOV.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\n\n1.  **Is it safe to update CTOV to a newer version?**\nYes, it is safe to update CTOV to a newer version. However, if you do experience any problems, please let the mod author know so that they can fix them.\n\n2.  **Is it safe to add CTOV to an already existing world?**\nYes, it is safe to add CTOV to an already existing world. However, the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n3.  **Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nCTOV is available for all three mod loaders: Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.\n\n4.  **How can I locate the new structures?**\nTo locate the new structures, you can use the `/locate` command.\n    For 1.18.2, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate ctov:\\[structure\\_from\\_list\\] <br>\n\n    For 1.19+, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list] <br>\n\n    The `[structure_from_list]` part of the command is the name of the structure that you want to locate. You can find a list of all the available structures in the CTOV documentation.\n\n5.  **Does CTOV modify existing vanilla structures?**\nThe only structures that are modified by CTOV are vanilla villages in older versions. In newer versions, CTOV creates its own structures that are separate from vanilla villages.\n\n6.  **What about the loot of these structures?**\nThe vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility. However, they also use some custom loot tables to integrate said structures into the world better. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but you may also find new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies.\n\n7.  **How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nTo report bugs, issues, or suggestions, please go to the CTOV GitHub repo and create an issue. You can also message the mod author on Discord.\n\n8.  **Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**\nYes, you can include CTOV in your modpack. However, please be sure to give credit to the mod author and provide a link to their page.\n\n9.  **Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**\nIf it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Please don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n10.  **Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**\nThe mod author does not accept commissions or monetary support. They are doing this as a hobby and do not want to be paid for their work.\n\nI hope this answers all of your questions.\n</details>\n\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER4.webp)**\n\n\n**ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is compatible with most world-generation and structure mods.** It also works with Guard Villager and other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem. Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs.\n\nHere are some more details about the compatibility of CTOV with other mods:\n\n-   **World-generation mods:** CTOV relies on vanilla biome Tags, so almost all world-generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome You'll Go, and Biomes O'plenty will have appropriate CTOV villages in their biomes.\n-   **Structure mods:** Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures also work well with CTOV. However, it is important to exercise caution when using too many mods, as this can cause instability.

**[ForgetMeChunk](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forgetmechunk)**\n- **[ChunkSavingFix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunk-saving-fix)**\n-

[Curseforge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/debugify) • [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/debugify) • [Patched bug list](https://github.com/isXander/Debugify/blob/1.19/PATCHED.md) • [Discord](https://short.isxander.dev/discord)\n\n## What if I want to enable some bug fixes, but not others?\nDebugify has a configuration GUI accessible by Fabric's [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).\nIf you don't want to it, there is always the configuration file located at\n`.minecraft/config/debugify.json`\n\n![configuration menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/191992486-4ba9bd8f-db37-4021-b302-7f54701d8b08.png)\n\n## Client, or Server?\nDebugify includes many fixes for both the client and server (all server fixes also apply to client).\nSo you should definitely use it on both.\n\n## Can I include this in my modpack?\nYes! Of course! I even added a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain,\nso I added a config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.\n\n## Credits\n-

Both are done by blurring the texture of the block, doing some calculations and applying that color to the scene with.\n\nMost other shaderpacks with 3D volumetric clouds have a problem of them leaking into closed spaces like caves or mountains. Solas fixes that problem by toggling a cloud shadow check in cases when a closed space is detected, thus essentially turning volumetric clouds into volumetric light.\n\nAnother problem a lot of shaderpacks have is shadow light leaking and peter panning which is not minimized in Solas.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**Key Features**\n+ 3D volumetric clouds and light rays.\n+ Volumetric Nether and End fog.\n+ Water, atmospheric and border fog.\n+ Fast colored lighting and global illumination.\n+ Fancy sky effects: aurora borealis, Milky Way, ender nebula, ender vortex and more.\n+ Cinematic post effects: bloom, chromatic aberration, depth of field, image sharpening, adjustable and flexible tonemap, TAA, FXAA.\n+ Integrated PBR resourcepack with generated emissives, specular and normals.\n+ Advanced lighting model: vanilla & custom ambient occlusion, variable penumbra shadows.\n+ Many customizable options with their proper translations to English, Russian, Chinese, French and Spanish languages.","published":"2022-12-13T19:07:08.160319Z","updated":"2023-11-24T13:44:00.239436Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":183636,"followers":386,"categories":["colored-lighting","fantasy","pbr"],"additional_categories":["atmosphere","bloom","cartoon","foliage","low","reflections","semi-realistic","shadows"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"],"versions":["y4j12BxK","ogGYWNdQ","bNMgAWCx","YZMWbh4h","xHgx5Bvx","WavyjcdU","IFUoT1yb","ktRmeTUY"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EpQFjzrQ/78660094ffc8b00c1f805137250401309991bc2b.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"xHgx5Bvx","project_id":"EpQFjzrQ","author_id":"dilHPVn4","featured":false,"name":"Solas Shader V1.6","version_number":"1.6","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-08T12:00:02.678593Z","downloads":24441,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e08e9062ba1f7e4705b45a2e162f9a52501e7e2b","sha512":"cfc533b162c642b87953a487b083679ebf12f86b008a5e307d0149af796cd03d55188f18322d8ab9b0c164acdf64f0aec8985cf0735e8492984b9ce71d92774c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EpQFjzrQ/versions/xHgx5Bvx/Solas%20V1.6.zip","filename":"Solas V1.6.zip","primary":false,"size":1184526,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"]},"members":[{"team_id":"FeXBCccN","user":{"id":"dilHPVn4","username":"septonious","name":"Septonious","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83358692?v=4","bio":"I make shaders","created":"2021-07-23T13:39:53.718189Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Solas V1.6.zip"},"mods\\DisableCustomWorldsAdvice-4.1.jar":{"sha512":"79b3aee9199c39d2e3320e9f1e0bd6c208f50ba3f7ba0c42649d0197cb27bc5cebb90a1defd9acaca29cbe3f2d6816ab619e043528f9a48ad2465d9795dd7f40","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"HdwRs3kc","slug":"dcwa","project_type":"mod","team":"xP4fKKoW","title":"Disable Custom Worlds Advice","description":"Minecraft asking you if you want to load a custom world is annoying.

selection\n\nWe cannot guarantee that Icons will work with packs that change the font of Minecraft nor mods that make use of strings that we work with since it was made with the default textures and vanilla in mind\n\n***\n\n#### **❓ How to use**\n\nDrop the pack into your resource packs folder or Drag and Drop it in the Resource pack Selection\n\nSelect Icons\n\n(Have it on top of other packs if you use more)\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/974996311914995754/1068331418998034472/abovepacks.png)\n\nSelect the language in that you want to play\n\n“Force Unicode” must be turned

It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n# 📈 Benchmarks\n\nThe following performance comparisons have been contributed by our community, and they show how Sodium can improve frame rates for a wide range of computers, whether fast or slow. Many of our players report a **250% to 500% increase** in average frame rates.\n\n- AMD Ryzen 5 5600H / NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142405940545585233/2023-08-19_12.24.14.png) 34 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142405941036331019/2023-08-19_12.27.45.png) 253 fps) [7.4x faster]\n- AMD Ryzen 5 5600 / NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1141912049392296046/2023-08-17_21.46.37.png) 62 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1141912050084347914/2023-08-17_21.48.26.png) 516 fps) [8.3x faster]\n- Intel Xeon E5-1620v3 / AMD RX 6400 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142235253193318441/2023-08-19_00.50.49.png) 52 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142235253738586234/2023-08-19_01.14.25.png) 216 fps) [4.1x faster]\n- AMD Ryzen 3450U / AMD Vega 8 Graphics ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1141919288047976448/2023-08-17_22.15.37.png) 49 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1141919288542892254/2023-08-17_22.18.12.png) 118 fps) [2.4x faster]\n- Intel Core i5-11400 / Intel UHD 730 Graphics ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142235069117890731/2023-08-19_05.07.07.png) 39 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142235069747048511/2023-08-19_04.55.38.png) 110 fps) [2.8x faster]\n- Intel Core i3-4170 / NVIDIA GeForce GT 710 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142286136782372984/2023-08-19_10.27.03.png) 38 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142286137050791986/2023-08-19_10.23.28.png) 86 fps) [2.2x faster]\n- Intel Celeron G5900 / Intel UHD Graphics 610 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142299880228925530/2023-08-18_23.10.08.png) 62 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142299880656736337/2023-08-18_23.08.18.png) 155 fps) [2.5x faster]\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/Fud5oyF.png))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison above water](https://i.imgur.com/z9HBcvq.png), [comparison below water](https://i.imgur.com/QQMuOTy.png).) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/lYmlmgq.png)) which helps to make everything look smoother.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.

Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again.

There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-13T21:48:54.507121Z","updated":"2023-10-29T14:01:22.889842Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":241424,"followers":1020,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["Q9qUUqA7","Wd3Co0mZ","81tshMIZ","Xf5mFGCS","jUK1mCz3","1latp88m","pNFzTzQd","mLdNNka6","K3S6BASh","aYOzrVFZ","Y4i2gvLB","D0hKeWDQ","JT2esX5R","8N8lLvTW","34PhE3zd","2w1uZoRC","PNByHzei","WZvndtxX","UJtMNPNx","Rq2BBA8A","hYoo0DKV","CDrDiFNK","qFd4s3fV","FOe2l0tx","IWVbiEbl","1hOeraaL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/34c751cc804839ed3c1d9f21dfd53d98368fedfc.png"},"version":{"id":"1hOeraaL","project_id":"8oi3bsk5","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v2.4.8 ~ 1.20.2","version_number":"2.4.8","changelog":"# Terralith v2.4.8\n- Repainted the Painted Mountains\n- Reword the \"welcome toast\" to be clear what the Discord link is for.

No more!**\n\nUpgraded backpack can provide about **60 inventory slots** and **2 fluid tanks**, each of which can store up to 6 buckets of fluid or even 24 bottles of potion (Now even more, since it's configurable!). All inventory slots and tanks can be accessed via external pipes. The backpack also provides special buttons - **sort**, **quick stack** and **transfer** to seamlessly manage inventory!\n\n- **Tier Upgrades**\n\nBackpack has to be **upgraded** to reach its maximum storage and tank capacity. Upgrading can be done at a **smithing table** by placing a leather in template slot, higher tier upgrade and a backpack in next slots. Although the backpack can't be directly upgraded to the Netherite tier, it has to be upgraded to all lower tiers first. To reset upgrades, place the backpack on the ground and Shift + Right-click while holding a Blank Upgrade in your hand.\n\n- **Chestplate or backpack? Why not both?**\n\nTraveler's backpack doesn't need any empty armor slot (or other slot, unless Curios integration is enabled) to be worn. The player can wear one backpack on their back at a time and its inventory can be accessed via the **B** (Configurable) button.\n\n- **The best gear for adventures!**\n\nYou are able to use crafting inside the backpack's inventory or pull out the sleeping bag whenever you want! Don't worry, you won't lose your spawn point! Also it's worth taking advantage of handy tool slots (Tool swapping described on Wiki). The fluid tanks, in combination with Hose Item (Hose functioning described on Wiki) provide good portable fluid storage.\n\n- **Customization that you have never seen!**\n\nChoose your personal style from over 45 custom backpacks, which represent various creatures and blocks. As if that weren't enough, some of them can provide special abilities! 1.16+ versions provide **dyed backpack**. You can combine whichever dyes you want to create a unique look!\n\n![end travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/E1YYiRf.png)\n\n## Backpacks and Inventory Preview\n<details>\n<summary>Click</summary>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cRRnmSb.png\" alt=\"all backpacks showcase\" height=\"650\" width = \"584\"/>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XBB0wlj.gif\" width=\"584\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n\n</details>\n\n![bee travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/HpldKTS.png)\n\n*** \n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ufbnlYZ.png\" alt=\"kinetic hosting banner\" width=\"800\" height=\"281\"/>](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=102)\n\n## Modpacks\nYou are allowed to use this mod in public/private modpacks.

outside, extremely dark...\nYou can't see a lot in the darkness, you wish you had a torch,\nor a lantern to hold and see in the light...\n\nAnd this is now possible with this mod as it adds dynamic lights to the game.\nYou can see in the darkness thanks to your torch now!\n\nThis mod adds dynamic lights to Minecraft. Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? [Check out this list!](https://optifine.alternatives.lambdaurora.dev/)\n\n## ✅ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Items emit light\n\nDropped items which already emit light as a block, will also dynamically emit light!\n\n![Torch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/21/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Held items emit light\n\nLight is emitted when entities hold light emitting items.\n\n![Fox holding lantern](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/22/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Fire! Fire! Fire!\n\nAny entity on fire will emit light!\n\n![Skeleton on fire!](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/23/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Spectral arrows\n\nSpectral arrows will emit a very weak light!\n\n![Spectral arrows](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/25/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Different luminance!\n\nLight emitted from items depend on the light emitted from their respective blocks!\n\n![light levels](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/26/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Configuration GUI\n\nAs of v2.1.0.\n\n![Configuration GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_main.png)\n![Entities Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_entities.png)\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\nUsing this mod is very simple!\n\nInstall it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu], (and [Sodium] if wanted for better performances).\n\nYou will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu], you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!\nYou can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.\n\nNeed help? Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p style=\"color: red\">Please, when you write the name of this mod, don't add spaces.</p>**\n\n[fabric]: https://fabricmc.net\n[Mod loader: Fabric]: https://img.shields.io/badge/modloader-Fabric-1976d2?style=flat-square&logo=data:image/png;base64,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\n[Fabric API]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api \"Fabric API CurseForge page\"\n[ModMenu]: https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu\n[Sodium]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium \"Sodium CurseForge page\"\n[Canvas]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer \"Canvas CurseForge page\"\n[LambdAurora Discord]: https://discord.gg/abEbzzv\n","published":"2020-12-21T15:59:13.578447Z","updated":"2023-11-11T12:01:29.921361Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1390431,"followers":3988,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.1-pre1","1.18.1-rc1","1.18.1-rc2","1.18.1-rc3","1.18.2","1.18.2-pre1","1.18.2-pre2","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2-rc1","1.18-rc1","1.18-rc2","1.18-rc3","1.18-rc4","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","22w03a","22w05a","22w06a","22w07a"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["YuZK7F05","kaKDsLxl","hKXQNf9z","8zO3sewB","s0scL0LW","GiwO5rBh","zhBXhMhZ","Fp4gUsxF","YQkZSlfq","9E1ECN95","7Cx8p05b","85Jaf9ic","Vsx4I8Np","mYl4RvKg","i6nks8QI"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/yBW8D80W/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"i6nks8QI","project_id":"yBW8D80W","author_id":"rRnTb0fG","featured":false,"name":"LambDynamicLights 2.3.3 (1.20)","version_number":"2.3.3+1.20.2","changelog":"- Added Japanese translations ([#187](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/pull/187)).\n- Updated to Minecraft 1.20.2 ([#194](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/pull/194)).\n  -

The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2023-09-23T14:02:42.436211Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1750703,"followers":4380,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Lue6O9z9","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.27 for Minecraft 1.20.x/Sodium 0.5.3/Fabric API 0.89+","version_number":"1.0.27+mc1.20.1","changelog":"- Bump version (comp500)\n- Support new Fabric API changes and Sodium 0.5.3 (comp500)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.27+mc1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-23T14:02:51.056536Z","downloads":441665,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"c6e6627b8bb6a40497f27f86619ee5f17f68386f10585b4944e1aad01337a8f55be7401bc1824c69f94d755db3faaf16537b1d2d2cd282d24393d61df9b6fbef","sha1":"8c8e6b96243155b41f2f9d29d5940ee895bcb141"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/Lue6O9z9/indium-1.0.27%2Bmc1.20.1.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.27+mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":104807,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"4OZL6q9h","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.27+mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\dynamic-fps-3.2.1+minecraft-1.20.0.jar":{"sha512":"6ca9280ee22153552cdb4a75454850c2b75914d661afdea97c11a7c70370631f8f1574233c52ab46e36e97b9caed3f3574eee95169b2382d1b7a1e96973bdb77","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"LQ3K71Q1","slug":"dynamic-fps","project_type":"mod","team":"qgYomxyl","title":"Dynamic FPS","description":"Improve performance when Minecraft is in the background.","body":"Dynamic FPS automatically reduces the speed at which Minecraft renders when it's not focused (to 1 FPS) or hidden (no renders at all).\n\nIt also fixes a bug in Vanilla Minecraft that makes it take much more performance in the background than it should, as well as making the game not render while reloading resources (which can make it take forever on machines with integrated GPUs).\n\nThere is an in-game config screen.

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2023-10-01T09:40:10.683782Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":435479,"followers":1100,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","b1.7.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"m0Dd8Cjy","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20+

mod will change the way you break trees. 2 modes are available:\n* Instantaneous: Break one log and the whole tree will fall\n* Shift down: Break a block and the log will slowly shift down as you cut it (good if you don't want to \"cheat\" too much but are lazy to go cut top log blocks 😛)\n\n![Demonstration of breaking a

It includes support for a <em>bunch</em> of modded dimensions.\n</p>\n\n## Adding Custom Sounds\n<p>To use custom sounds, all you have to do is create a small resource pack with the namespace <code>travelerstitles</code>. In the <code>sounds</code> folder, you can add any or all of three custom sounds, named <code>dimension.ogg</code>, <code>biome.ogg</code>, and <code>waystone.ogg</code>. Each of these sounds will play when entering a new dimension, biome, and waystone, respectively. If no custom sound is provided for any of these, then no sound will play for the respective type of title.\n</p>\n\n## Additional Customization\n<p>Using lang files in resource packs, you can add your own dimension &amp; biome titles!<br />\nDimensions use a lang entry format like the following:</p>\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.namespace.dimensionname\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n<p>Biomes use the same lang entries as always, guaranteeing built-in support for any mod's biomes, like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>However, should you want to change a vanilla or modded biome's title without potentially affecting other areas of the game that might use the biome's translation, you can use a special format specifically for this mod via the following:\n</p>\n\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Both dimensions and biomes also support an optional <code>color</code> lang entry which will override the configured default text color for that specific dimension or biome. The following is a complete example that adds a red title for the Nether and a green title for the Plains biome:<br />\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether\": \"The Nether\",\n\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.minecraft.plains\": \"Plains\",\n\"biome.minecraft.plains.color\": \"00ff00\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that for a biome's <code>color</code> entry, it is also acceptable to have the key start with <code>travelerstitles</code>, and any biome color entry with <code>travelerstitles</code> prepended to it will take priority over other entries.<br />\nFor example, the following would resullt in blue (<code>0000ff</code>) text for the <code>desert</code> biome, since entries prepended with <code>travelerstitles</code> take priority:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"biome.minecraft.desert.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.desert.color\": \"0000ff\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also note that colors are RGB hex-formatted strings.</span></p>\n\n<p><a title=\"Lang entries\" href=\"https://github.com/YUNG-GANG/Travelers-Titles/tree/1.19/Common/src/main/resources/assets/travelerstitles/lang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">See here</a> for the lang entries that come included with the mod in 1.19.2. Lang entries for other versions may be available on a different branch.</p>\n\n## Debug commands\n<p>The following commands work in single player worlds if you have sufficient permissions. They can be used to preview what titles will look like when you encounter them in the game.</p>\n\n<p><code>/biometitle &lt;biome&gt;</code><br />\n<code>/dimensiontitle &lt;dimension&gt;</code></p>","published":"2022-11-28T23:26:24.670551Z","updated":"2023-09-06T19:56:43.945684Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":107176,"followers":423,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["nIfqKsvT","yLYslqqw","8j6rQRir","U7s0a0fP","olf32JwT","yOjVCeqk","ZA3ahpCR","xcHI86YI"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/5f218490f1edb9c55fd18e05f52247727117b93f.png"},"version":{"id":"xcHI86YI","project_id":"JtifUr64","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.20] v4.0.1 (Fabric)","version_number":"1.20-Fabric-4.0.1","changelog":"1.20 and 1.20.1 release!

It does require OptiFine to work, though.\n\n> **Q: Can you make a Bedrock port?**  \n> **A:**  It's not as simple as porting it. To make a version that would work on Bedrock, I would have to start from scratch. So that's not something I plan to do any time soon if ever.\n\n> **Q: Can you add player animations?**  \n> **A:**  Sadly no. Optifine currently doesn't support player animations. It may be possible with other mods, but I haven't looked into it yet.\n\n> **Q: Why isn't the ___ animated? Can you add it?**  \n> **A:**  Not all the mobs are animated yet. Fresh Animations is a Beta pack so it is developed over time, so new mobs animations will be added in major updates.  \n> I work and add new animations at my own pace, so please refrain from requesting animations.\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have white eyes and no new animations when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This occurs when you haven't installed the Optifine Mod correctly, OR Custom Entity Models is not enabled in Video Settings. The required settings are as follows:  \n> _Video Settings > Quality > Custom Entity Models: ON_  \n> _Random Entities: ON (optional)_  \n> _Emissive Textures: ON (optional)_  \n> **A:**  This can also happen with some 3rd party clients.  \n> **A:**  Also make sure you're using the right Optifine version (refer to the next question below).\n\n> **Q: With Fresh Animations 1.8, why are the mobs invisible / have invisible parts?**  \n> **A:**  This happens with some game versions including 1.18.1, 1.18 and 1.17.x. Use Optifine HD U H9 or newer to use the main pack.  \n> For 1.18 and 1.17.x, use the alternative version of the resource pack  [(FreshAnimations_v1.7_Alt.zip)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fresh-animations/files/3919356).\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have big purple/black textures when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This often occurs when the pack is loaded in. I think it's caused by an Optifine bug. To solve this, you need to exit the game and re-launch it.\n\n> **Q: Is Fresh Animations compatible with ___ ?**  \n> **A:**  Probably not completely. Textures for some mobs break with other packs as they are resized in FA. Other packs with custom entity models won't work as it would override the models FA.  \n> Otherwise, textures for most mobs should be fine. A solution for some packs is to make an 'addon' version using Optifine CEM Parts.\n\n> **Q: The pack is warning me that it's made for another version of Minecraft. Which version should I get?**  \n> **A:**  Any version of this pack should work as intended in most versions, as long as there's a version of Optifine to run it. I recommend using the latest version for the latest updates and new animations.\n> Don't worry about the version warning!\n\n> **Q: Is there a way to use Fresh Animations without OptiFine?**  \n> **A:**  Fresh Animations requires Optifine features like Custom Entity Models (CEM) to work. Some Optifine CEM alternative mods are being developed. I recommend [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) which almost entirely works, and will improve as it's developed further.\n\n----------\n\n[<img src=\"https://imgur.com/BpoAtYQ.png\" alt=\"Donate Button\" width=\"400\"/>](https://ko-fi.com/freshlx) [<img src=\"https://imgur.com/jNCfwOy.png\" alt=\"Discord Button\" width=\"400\"/>](https://discord.gg/Wxs7JEPMrH)\n\n----------\n\n[![Creative Commons License](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)  \n](https://www.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252fcreativecommons.org%252flicenses%252fby-nc-sa%252f4.0%252f) This work is licensed under a  [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).  \n  \n\n-   Feel free to include this resource pack in your mod pack or server.\n-   If you wish to use this pack in any form of content, please credit with a link to the original CurseForge or PMC page where you can.","published":"2022-08-29T01:33:56.443874Z","updated":"2023-07-17T11:16:38.203638Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":88099,"followers":587,"categories":["entities","realistic","vanilla-like"],"additional_categories":["16x","models","themed","tweaks"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["minecraft"],"versions":["s5KTavJK","KQ9bQsZi","O8LeIQn4","E3rgzhGg","WhoErU2P","SaV3drbz"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/50dA9Sha/a49a324c9210aaf7f5899199af2eaf6ff345b4ef.png"},"version":{"id":"SaV3drbz","project_id":"50dA9Sha","author_id":"OffNOjBf","featured":false,"name":"FA 1.8.1","version_number":"1.8.1","changelog":"Thank you for over 9 million downloads!\n\n---\n## Base Pack\n\nBuilt for 1.19.4 + OptiFine HD U I3 or newer; issues may occur in older versions.\nhttps://optifine.net/downloads\n\n \n### Changes:\n- Updated Vex model and animations\n- Tweaked Drowned animation for 1.19.4\n- Improved Guardian and Elder Guardian\n- Tweaked Wolf slightly\n- Tweaked Cod slightly\n- Tweaked Salmon slightly\n- Tweaked Tropical Fish slightly\n- Tweaked Villager variation\n- Other various adjustments\n\n \n\n### Fixes:\n- Fixed Vex for 1.19.3 model\n- Fixed Vex model part support\n- Fixed Drowned arms for 1.19.4\n- Fixed Snow Fox eyes texture\n- Fixed Villager hat overlay UV\n- Fixed Villager nose offset when shaking head\n- Fixed Villager 'nope' action when riding or swimming\n- Fixed Horse, Donkey & variants' animation speed when ridden for 1.19.4\n- Fixed Frog walk animation speed for 1.19.4\n- Fixed Dolphin left eyelid and eye position from a distance\n- Mirrored UVs for Spider and Cave Spider legs\n- Other various fixes\n\n \n\n \n\n---\n## Extensions\n\nThe add-on pack has been split into separate 'extension' packs.\n\nFresh Animations Extensions has arrived!

Since each Chunk\nmeasures `16x16` blocks from a top-down view, you can easily convert between block and chunk coordinates by multiplying / dividing\nby `16`. You can also find the current chunk position with the `F3` debug menu:\n\n<img alt=\"chunkPos\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-gen/main/img/chunkPos_real.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nIt is currently not possible to use *WorldGen* directly from the \"Create New World\" screen. Instead, you have\nto first create the world normally, save and quit, and then open the world with *WorldGen*.\n\nFurthermore, we recommend storing your world on an SSD (at least for running *WorldGen*). Using a hard drive can lead\nto scenarios where new chunks are generated faster than previously generated chunks can be saved. This can cause out-of-memory\nerrors, since more and more chunks will accumulate in RAM as time goes on. Additionally, the performance\nof the generator itself may be negatively affected. \n\nAlthough we consider *WorldGen* to be stable, it is recommended to back up your world before using this mod. \nWe are not responsible if you lose your world because you ran into a bug!\n\n## Recommended settings\n\nWhen using *WorldGen*, there is no real upper limit on how many chunks can be generated. \nHowever, we do not recommend using a radius of more than `512` chunks (which would be `8192` blocks in each direction).\n\n## How it works\n\nIn contrast to other existing chunk pre-generation methods our mod does not require a full Minecraft server to be running. \nInstead, a lightweight internal server is used to generate the chunks efficiently.\n\nThis has the advantage of having a **dedicated GUI** and allows **multithreading**. On the downside,\nthe world must be opened in a Minecraft client and cannot be loaded elsewhere while the chunks are being generated with *WorldGen*.\n\n## Supported version\n\nThis table shows the current support status for the Minecraft version.\n\n| Minecraft Version | Status    |\n|-------------------|-----------|\n| `1.20.x`          | Supported |\n| `1.19.x`          | No future updates |\n| `1.18.2`          | No future updates |\n\nNote: For both `1.19.1` and `1.19.2` Use the WorldGen 1.19.x version. However, for Minecraft `1.19.3` and above, the specific WorldGen version for the Minecraft release is required!\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q:** *The progress screen does not fit and is cut off!*\n\n**A:** Try reducing the GUI scale in the Minecraft video options until it fits \n\n---\n\n**Q:** *How do I center the square / rectangle / circle around my current position?*\n\n**A:** Click on the square button on the right of the Center chunk selection row. This will automatically load\n   the last position of the player.\n\n---\n\n**Q:** *Will Minecraft versions before 1.18.2 be supported?*\n\n**A:** No.\n\n---\n\n**Q:** *How do I reset chunks to their original state?*\n\n**A:** First of all: **BACK UP YOUR WORLD!** Afterwards: In the advanced WorldGen settings enable the \"Please allow me to\n   break my world!\" checkbox, then enable \"Override existing chunks\". Also, we recommend using the \"Mode: Coordinates\"\n   in the main menu to reduce the chance of resetting chunks you don't want to!\n\n---\n\n**Q:** *How do I make a perimeter / replace all blocks in chunks with air?*\n\n**A:** First of all again: **BACK UP YOUR WORLD!** Afterwards: In the advanced WorldGen settings enable the \"Please allow me to\n   break my world!\" checkbox. Then, set \"Max. chunk status\" to `structure_starts`. Next, enable \"Override\n   existing chunks\". Finally, set \"Fake chunk status\" to `full`. \n   The generation will stop early and save the chunk as a fully generated one.\n   The \"Max. chunk status\" option allows stopping at different stages of generation, allowing for experimentation.\n\n## Mod incompatibilities\n\nThis mod should be compatible with most mods (including those adding new biomes and dimensions).\nHowever, mods that interfere with the Minecraft world generation process might pose a problem.\n\n### Currently known incompatible mods\n\n| Mod           | Failure                                                  |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Starlight** | Chunks generated with WorldGen will have **no** lighting |\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nMany thanks to the

zoom mod with infinite customizability.*\n\nZoomify aims to provide the easiest, most configurable and most sexy looking zoom mod you will ever find.\n\n![Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/zoom-example.gif)\n\n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n</center></div>\n\n## How to use\n### Keybind\nInitially, Minecraft has a keybind that overrides Zoomify by default.\nGo to the controls menu and make sure the Zoomify keybind (default `C`)\nisn't conflicting (goes red).\n\n### Open settings menu\nYou can access the settings menu with two ways.\n\n- The client command `/zoomify`\n- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) settings button\n\n## Features\n### Scroll Zoom\nYou can zoom in further using your scroll wheel.\n\n![Scroll Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/scroll-zoom-example.gif)\n\n### Spyglass Integration\nYou can configure Zoomify to only be able to zoom in when you are holding or carrying a spyglass.\nOr even just override the spyglass zoom with Zoomify!\n\nShow the spyglass overlay and play spyglass sound effects when using Zoomify.\n\n![Spyglass Integration Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/spyglass-integration-example.gif)\n\n### Transitions\n**14 different** transitions to choose from!\n\n- Instant\n- Linear\n- [Ease in Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInSine)\n- [Ease out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeOutSine)\n- [Ease in/out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInOutSine)\n- [Ease in Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInQuad)\n- [Ease out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeOutQuad)\n- [Ease in/out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInOutQuad)\n- [Ease in Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInCubic)\n- [Ease out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeOutCubic)\n- [Ease in/out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic)\n- [Ease in Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInExp)\n- [Ease out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeOutExp)\n- [Ease in/out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInOutExp)\n\nYou can even pick what transition you would like for zooming in and out individually!\n\n![Individual Transition Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/individual-transition.png)\n\n### Relative Sensitivity\nReduce your mouse sensitivity based on the amount of zoom,\nso you have fine control over your player.\n\n![Relative Sensitivity Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-sensitivity-example.gif)\n\n### Relative View Bobbing\nReduce the view bobbing effect based on the amount of zoom,\nso you can walk and zoom at the same time!\n\n![Relative View Bobbing Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-view-bobbing-example.gif)\n\n### Cinematic Camera\nMake the mouse/camera smooth, like the zoom in [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).\n\n![Cinematic Cam Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/cinematic-cam-example.gif)\n\n### Affect Hand FOV\nTurn off this setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!\n\n![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)\n\n### Secondary Zoom\n\nCompletely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.\nAimed for content creators, features `Hide HUD While Zooming` option and longer zoom in times.\n\n![Secondary Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/secondary-zoom.gif)\n\n### Presets\n\nYou can reset to default, make Zoomify behave like OptiFine and others!\n\n### Smart Keybinding Detection\n\nOn first launch, if a keybinding is conflicting with Zoomify's zoom, a notification will appear notifying them of this.\n\n![Keybinding Conflict Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/keybind-conflict-detection.png)\n\n### Highly configurable\nAbsolutely **NO** hard-coded values. Everything about your zoom is configurable!\n\n### Control the zoom speed with seconds\nInstead of some stupid arbitrary value such as zoom speed, you can pick\nthe exact amount of seconds it will take to zoom in, with a separate setting for zooming out.\n\n### Credits\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - Developer\n- [MoonTidez](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Logo designer\n\n####

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2023-09-23T21:11:09.410835Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2989169,"followers":7171,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"qdzL5Hkg","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium 0.12.0","version_number":"mc1.20.2-0.12.0","changelog":"Lithium 0.12.0 is the first release for 1.20.2 and includes a new package for experimental optimizations which are disabled by default.\n\nYou can check out all configuration options at [description of all optimizations here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/blob/mc1.20.2-0.12.0/lithium-mixin-config.md).\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/compare/mc1.20.1-0.11.2...mc1.20.2-0.12.0\n\n## Additions\n- new: several optimizations in the experimental package\n- new: (experimental) entity optimizations based on block caching  \n- new: (experimental) iterate entities by chunk for spawning conditions \n- new: small ice spreading check optimization\n- new: Only purge expiring ChunkTickets","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-23T21:11:23.593795Z","downloads":285288,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"9b713d4909582d900274dcd7ca01abd195b53520","sha512":"88df5f96ee5a3011dbb2aae011b5c85166f9942906e4ebc58ebb7b452f01e18020b970aad3facebd02eb67ac4beea03de333414cf66172d817fa5cae50e1c73d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/versions/qdzL5Hkg/lithium-fabric-mc1.20.2-0.12.0.jar","filename":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.2-0.12.0.jar","primary":true,"size":688442,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"uhPSqlnd","username":"2No2Name","name":"2No2Name","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50278648?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-31T09:13:58.517719Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":"JellySquid","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1363084?v=4","bio":"Professional idiot at day, maniac programmer by night.","created":"2021-01-03T00:49:18.373336Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.2-0.12.0.jar"},"shaderpacks\\VECTOR_v1.2.zip":{"sha512":"a18282c5acbc2ced96c3d4ce3bc43f7eea3ea0286cc217dd285c91640742841d01c4afa62ae35510bd336d30e48be5f8a1e2d36f15bade12e61adf6fdca86613","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"a8nz2nHG","slug":"vector","project_type":"shader","team":"ltnwmvao","title":"VECTOR","description":"Retrocomputing in Minecraft","body":"# VECTOR\n*Minecraft Retro-computing*\n\nDid you own an IBM PC?

my other mods.<br>\nThis mod does nothing on its own and its only purpose is to be the base of other mods.\n\nTechnically, you are free to use this mod as base mod for your own mods, but there's **currently no documentation** for it, so it would probably be a very annoying experience.\n\n\n## Bug Reports and Requests\n\nYou can report bugs and request features

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Lilypad\nCheck out Lilypad if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.net/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

with Fabric.\n\nFabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first.

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it.

mods.</p>\n<p><b>For all my mod devs out there - </b>This provides a lot of useful stuff, especially if you're a worldgen modder!</p>\n<p>The API includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AutoRegistration system (1.18+ only). Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure. If the given structure doesn't exist, the trigger simply fails rather than instantly passing (unlike vanilla).</li>\n<li>Interfaces for JSON serialization &amp; deserialization&nbsp;with built-in type adapters.</li>\n<li>Simple, lightweight math utilities for vectors and column positions</li>\n<li><em>BlockStateRandomizer</em> and <em>ItemRandomizer</em>, data abstractions that make adding block and item randomization to your structures incredibly simple. I use these for all of my mods!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're curious, you can check the code for my mods (especially the newer ones) to see how things work. Feel free to ask me any questions on Discord!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>","published":"2022-11-28T17:17:12.676483Z","updated":"2023-11-17T22:15:13.512743Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":280175,"followers":512,"categories":["library","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["xET3UZBe","UNVzqGkX","82XBGKbQ","xvoWCwex","LYoQlbQt","YwHWUw19","LEuKu3qt","Em3G31xp","dpSzBMP6","IOIGqCVr","i0Z1vSK9","YZE1pnbT","GNNfW5IV","IxuGYnWF","yIFytswN","h32n7OPC","4Ek11kQV","NmrTF2A5","TT8tnzlH","HIRzLg0r","pxmQWPn7","L5GqhLVE"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Ua7DFN59/38049bae08310ffed43435f717e309b15ec6f29d.png"},"version":{"id":"TT8tnzlH","project_id":"Ua7DFN59","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.20] v4.0.2 (Fabric)","version_number":"1.20-Fabric-4.0.2","changelog":"- Added new icon and logo!  \n- Added support for Catalogue  \n\nIf you want to get early access to all my mods, [Join the Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/yungnickyoung)  \n[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/rns3beq)  \n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung) for more mod updates!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-26T06:15:05.050233Z","downloads":74071,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"7867c426dd1a0832458a7adf09dd5fe8f62f2292","sha512":"ac1e0c5f2d8972123b45e4ac7ec711549acb6aedd2880696438df72fc2d4528f03217f3def371ecf65a1e480a41d35011cc7af1eb02885669879877af30dc3b5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Ua7DFN59/versions/TT8tnzlH/YungsApi-1.20-Fabric-4.0.2.jar","filename":"YungsApi-1.20-Fabric-4.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":1218431,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"3TidTIHz","user":{"id":"HCGwycZf","username":"YUNGNICKYOUNG","name":"Nick Young","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HCGwycZf/f4ec4b86f9778f12367fbd3a3e9f9e6af6830bee.png","bio":"Mr. Better Minecraft","created":"2022-11-13T01:46:47.603854Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":false},"file_name":"YungsApi-1.20-Fabric-4.0.2.jar.disabled"},"mods\\Clumps-fabric-1.20.2-13.0.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"5277d8351baf826679bfadb815c7838affd1459b339e81406ef51b0c7e7ad3ca0a4841974507ad1427d60d1434204ceece225eb0a170d4a50da1808331ee1e56","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Wnxd13zP","slug":"clumps","project_type":"mod","team":"twbRaNO5","title":"Clumps","description":"Clumps XP orbs together to reduce lag","body":"Clumps groups XP orbs together into a single entity to reduce lag when there are many in a small area.

This is __not__ required, but it allows all items to have their own beautiful textures.\n- Incendium is **not** compatible with Amplified Nether\n- Do not add this to an existing nether - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\n### Biomes\nIncendium adds 8 unique biomes to the nether. Do you bravely venture through the perilous **Quartz Flats**, wander the mysterious **Withered Forest**, or battle your way through the steep **Infernal Dunes**? Each biome has a unique personality and story to tell. With unique block themes in each biomes, opportunities for new farms for technical players, 3D biomes, and stunning terrain, there is truly something for everyone.\n\n### Structures\nTo compliment the lovely biomes, there are 9+ structures for you to explore and conquer. In the Ash Barrens, the **Foribdden Castle** stands forbodingly, with courageous Piglins defending its treasured loot - one of the largest and complex random structures in Minecraft! Alternatively, you can conquer the ominous **Sanctum** with its illagers defending dark secrets and strong weapons. The skeleton chef Torte defends his **Quartz Kitchen**, and the Withered Director his **Nether Reactor**. What will you conquer first?\n\n### Items\nEvery mob you defeat and structure you conquer has its reward - Incendium pays you handsomely with both rick loot and custom weapons! Defeating the Hovering Inferno could earn you the **Trailblazer** - a flame-spewing bow. A high damage, but taxing **Greatsword of Sacrifice** hides within the Forbidden Castle's walls, along with the helpful **Hefty Pickaxe**. Or maybe you prefer to find the **Hazmat Suit** to protect you from all types of poisonous attacks. There are over 25 items to forge your own playstyle with!\n\n### Mobs\nNo datapack would be complete without its own mobs to fight you. The Toxic Heap is home of the agile **Toxic Slimes**, and the Withered Forest is haunted by the **Restless Spirits**. On the other hand, you could go on a rescue missue to save the **Ghastling** from the Abandoned Tower - in return, it will defend you from Ghasts. If none of this is challenging, you can summon the all-powerful **Hovering Inferno** boss for a difficult and dirty battle.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-23T00:20:14.180965Z","updated":"2023-10-29T23:07:00.229603Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":90574,"followers":397,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["xnhu8xeb","NoanBvKE","S6fQNiYx","lS3rnfXC","nNDmHrHX","ednvmJkC","wdO4nfDE","QzTAZ3vy","4bK01rdc","g34x6icZ","OamdlEiS","QL8CxhjY"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZVzW5oNS/65c8dcaaf260e5b2182c228a1a442c792a7c4782.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"QL8CxhjY","project_id":"ZVzW5oNS","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v5.3.3 ~ 1.20.2","version_number":"5.3.3","changelog":"# Incendium v5.3.3\nWhile we patiently wait for the rework, here are some much needed bug fixes or temporary changes to relieve some common pain points.

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Lilypad\nCheck out Lilypad if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.net/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.
